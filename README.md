# Programming-Usfull-links
I created this Repo as a Refrence Folder with files that have Usfull links.
The links are going to be usfull for many different Programming cases.

As the beginning i am only puting the links i used or think are usfull to be used when coding. 
The links will be usfull for many different things in programming and coding world.

The startup Data or files are going to be simple Markdown files with the links and a little descriptions of them. 

In future i may try to make it more user friendly or even create a webapp for it. 

---------------------------------------------------------------
## Contribution :

All type of Contributions to the Repo are gladly welcommed.

### Contibuting to this project have two types :
* Adding links or Codes 
  Now there are no actuall codes , but maybe later the project will be turned to an application.
  So right now only new Links need to be added ! 
  While the project is just at the beginning so there is not a specific structure for adding links. 
  Later i will try to put specific structure and format for adding links or anything else in the project.
  All you need to do is just edit the Markdown file directly here or maybe clone the repo into your local machine then Edit the markdown files. Then by making a Pull request you can add your Links. 

* Suggestions 
  I donot have any actuall plan yet for the project.
  I would more than happy to get any suggestion for it.
  Suggestion can be suggested as an Issue.


Right now there is no Contributers yet , but when anyone Contributes i will do my best to add their name and refrences to their account plus the thing that they helped with . If it will be adding a link or Suggestions.
